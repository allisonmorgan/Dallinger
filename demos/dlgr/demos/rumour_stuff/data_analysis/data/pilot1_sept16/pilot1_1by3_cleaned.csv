0,2,"Back in the day, people did not die from diseases today such as diabetes and cancer, and the reason for this, was because they died before these diseases could even come to them. They were impaled by an ox, shot and died in war, or maybe even died of starvation.

While these things don't really happen as much in current day, there is a new threat to the lives of people. Antibiotic resistance. Antibiotics are used to treat infections caused by bacterial organisms. Penicillin was the first drug created to combat this sort of ailment. It has saved many lives over the years and many different types of antibiotics have been created to fight against different types of bacteria. Unfortunately however, these bacteria are starting to become resistant to this type of treatment. Antibiotic resistance is when bacteria become immune to an antibiotic rendering the drug useless. In the beginning this was a non issue, but as time progresses, more and more bacteria are starting to become resistant to these drugs.

There are steps that could be taken to decrease the odds of antibiotic resistance, but going at the current rate, there could be disastrous consequences if left unchanged. Currently there are around 50,000 in the United States alone that die due to bacterial infection that is resistant to antibiotics and when looking worldwide this number grows to 750,000. It's predicted that by 2050, this number will jump to a frightening 10 million deaths a year.

We can fight against antibiotic resistance by doing simple things such as choosing not to give our children antibiotics for a simple ear infection or refusing to eat chicken or other animals pumped full of antibiotics. With proper execution and changes, the fight against antibiotic resistance can be successful."

The more we take them for things that don't need them, the worse it will get. Currently there about 750,000 deaths per year worldwide due to antibiotic resistance, but it's estimated that in 2050 there could be as many as 10 million deaths per year. We can help counter this by not taking antibiotics for viral illnesses that don't need antibiotics, as well as not consuming meat that has been treated with antibiotics."

It is estimated that by 2050 there could be as many as 10 million deaths due to antibiotic resistance. We can help this situation by not taking antibiotics for viral diseases that don't need them, and by not consuming meat that has been treated with antibiotics."
