And they helped people to live longer healthier lives.  But now there are superbugs that are resistant to the antibiotics.  So we could be in trouble in the future."
0,3,"Antibiotic resistance is becoming an issue across the world. Infection was once one of the highest causes of death in the world, but penicillin changed this. Bacteria are now very resistant to most antibiotics, so infection is taking more and more people. By 2050, it could take 10 million people a year. We can all take steps to stop this by not buying meats pumped with antibiotics, and not using unnecessary antibiotics."
1,4,"People used to die from infections. Since the introduction and development of antibiotics in 1928, people live much longer. Antibiotics have created superbugs which might cause trouble for us in the future. "
1,5,"In 1928 an antibiotic, penicillin, was invented and that stopped people dying from infection. But in recent years, superbugs have been created and they are resistant to antibiotics due to overuse of them and the fact they are used in meats to protect animals and they are then passed down to us.."
2,8,In 1928 Penicillin was invented and helped reduce the amount of infections in the world through the use of antibiotics. However the use of antibiotics have created resistant super bugs that can be dangerous. Antibiotics used on livestock also pose a danger of creating more resistant germs.
2,9,"Anti-biotics were invented in 1928. Before that, people used to die of infections. Since the introduction of anti-biotics, like Pennicillin, people no longer die from infection. Now we have created super bugs, which are immune to anti-biotics. Anti-biotics were overprespribed and they are fed to animals who pass them down to us."
