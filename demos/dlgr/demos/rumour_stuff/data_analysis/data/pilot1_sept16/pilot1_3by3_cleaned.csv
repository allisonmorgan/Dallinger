0,9,"It used to be that the leading killers of death in the modern world, heart disease and cancer, didn't kill people long ago. They didn't live long enough to die from these diseases. It was much more likely that they would die by getting injured by a weapon of some sort. If the injury didn't kill them, the infection most likely would. However, with the advent of antibiotics it was a new era. People could get an infection and be fine in a couple of days. The discovery of antibiotics saved many lives during World War II.
Unfortunately, the issue of people dying from infections is once again on the rise. There is a new problem called ""superbugs"". These are infections that are resistant to most or all strains of antibiotics that science has developed. It is likened to a road race between scientists developing new antibiotics and superbugs becoming resistant. The superbugs are quicker and they are winning.  Many pharmaceutical companies now don't feel it is advantageous for them to develop new antibiotics, so infections are now able to move across the world unchecked. It is estimated that in the future, more people than the entire population of NYC will be killed by these bugs.
There is something people can do to slow this phenomena. Not jumping into giving your child an antibiotic when they may have an ear infections, but you are not positive. Not jumping into taking antibiotics in general unless you are absolutely sure that the infection is present and the antibiotics are going to be effective in treating it is helpful. Another helpful thing that everyone can do is to stop buying chicken or shrimp raised with antibiotics. These are small steps, but if everyone contributes, we can slow the superbugs down."
1,15,"One of the most important problems we face in the modern era is something called ""superbugs"". It is the phenomenon of infection causing bacteria and other pathogens getting more and more resistant to the antibiotics we develop as time goes by. We have a culture of overusing antibiotics. It started around the time of world war 2. Those times, people were constantly dying of infections as we had no solutions to these problems. Then Alexander Fleming discovered Penicillin in 1928. It saved almost 10-15% of the allied troops in said period. However, as time went by, we started overusing these antibiotics in everyday life, thereby the bugs got more resistant. Every year 50,000 people die in US and Europe alone because of this. We can combat this by taking antibiotics only if we are absolutely sure that we have infections, and by reducing consumption of antibiotics treated chicken and shrimp."
0,13,"Throughout history, most people didn't die of cancer or lifestyle diseases because they didn't live long enough to get them. Instead they died from different injuries and infections.
After antibiotics were discovered it did a lot to help people that were suffering from infections and helped to save between 12-15% of the Allied forces in World War 2. Penicillin was discovered by Alexander Fleming.
Now, people are dying because of antibiotic resistance or ""super-bugs"". We would make a drug and the bacteria would get better at adapting to it, then we'd make another one and so on. 
There are about 700 thousand deaths per year because of antibiotic resistance and it will continue to grow.
Instead of giving an antibiotic to your kid when they have a small infection and eating animals that have been injected with antibiotics we should not do that."
1,17,"Today, may diseases are becoming resistent to antibiotics. At one time people didn't live long enough to die from disease. They would die from an injurgy and/or infection. Today, it is becoming like that once again becuase many infections are resistent to antibiotics. People can help by not jumping to tak an antibiotic and by avoiding animal meat with antibiotics."
1,16,"In the past people did not die of cancer or heart disease. They tended to die from injuries that led to infection because antibiotics had not been invented yet. Fast Forward to our modern times with antibiotics and people began to live longer as lives were being saved thanks to this amazing invention.  Nobody could foresee that superbugs would eventually be the result of us over treating with antibiotics. Super Bugs kill many people every year and are a direct cause of antibiotics being over prescribed and used way to often when not needed.We can all take small steps to help and try to prevent us from getting a super bug. A super bug is a drug resistant infection. Stop giving your children antibiotics every single time they have an ear infection, Stop feeding your children and yourself shrimp and chicken raised with antibiotics. "
