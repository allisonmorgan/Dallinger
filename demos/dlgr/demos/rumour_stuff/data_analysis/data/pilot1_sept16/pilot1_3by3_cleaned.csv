0,3,"We are entering an age of the superbug. In 1928, when Alexander Fleming discovered penicillin, antibiotics became the new miracle drug, since infection and sepsis were leading causes of death.
 Now we have a lot of antibiotic-resistant bacteria which are evolving at an ever-increasing rate. We must slow down or stop using antibiotics. "
0,5,"Most people throughout history died from injury or infection as a result of injury and not cancer or heart disease.  However, in 1928, Alexander Fleming discovered penicillin.  This has led to a ton of people surviving.  In WWII it saved between 12-15% of Allied Forces lives.  We're using them too much, though.  Not only are they used to stop infection but now they're also being used in food production.  The foods you eat like shrimp and beef often are raised with antibiotics.  As a result, ""superbugs"" have started to take over.  These are antibiotic-resistant bacteria.  Currently about 700,000 people are dying each year due to these new, stronger bacteria.  If we don't stop it soon, by 2050 there will be 10 million deaths a year due to superbugs."
0,9,"People used to die from injuries sustained during their lives, and mostly from the infections that resulted from them.  The rise of antibiotics prevented those infections and caused humans to have much longer lives.  This resulted in bacteria becoming resistant to antibiotics and is becoming a real concern."
1,11,"Due to the rise and increased use of antibiotics like penicillin and etc there is now an increased amount of super bugs. These are bugs that are becoming resilient to antibiotic and don't really get fazed by them. The main cause of this is the fact antibiotics are used everywhere and are really common now. There used to treat people, used on plants, and etc. And unless we stop using them so much, tons of people are going to start dying. Because the antibiotics they use now can't kill the super bugs. "
1,14,"In the past people more people died from injuries and infections. Then when antibiotics started coing into use, it helped with the infections and many people were saved and living longer lives. However, due to ihe increased use of antibiotics, infections are becoming resistant to these antibiotics and not helping and now more people are dying from being resistant to the antibiotics."

the rise of antiblotics prevent those infections and caused humans to have much longer lives."
