This is mostly because people didn't live long enough to develop them. They died of injuries -- being gored by an ox, shot on a battlefield, crushed in one of the new factories of the Industrial Revolution -- and most of the time from infection, which followed those injuries.

That changed when antibiotics were discovered. In 1928, Alexander Fleming discovered penicillin, a drug still used today to fight bacterial infections. Suddenly, infections that had been a death sentence became remedied within days. During World War II, this drug treated pneumonia and sepsis, and has been estimated to have saved between 12-15% of Allied Forces lives. We have been living inside the golden epoch of the miracle drugs, and now, we are coming to an end of it.

People are dying of infections again because of a phenomenon called antibiotic resistance, or popularly referred to as “superbugs”. Bacteria compete against each other for resources, for food, by manufacturing lethal compounds that they direct against each other. When we first made antibiotics, we took those compounds into the lab and made our own versions of them, and bacteria responded to our attack the way they always had.

For 70 years, we played a game of leapfrog -- our drug and their resistance, and then another drug, and then resistance again -- and now the game is ending. Bacteria develop resistance so quickly that pharmaceutical companies have decided making antibiotics is not in their best interest, so there are infections moving across the world for which, out of the more than 100 antibiotics available on the market, two drugs might work with side effects, or one drug, or none.

It would be natural to hope that these infections are extraordinary cases, but in fact, in the United States and Europe, 50 thousand people a year die of infections which no drugs can help. A project chartered by the British government known as the Review on Antimicrobial Resistance estimates that the worldwide toll right now is 700 thousand deaths a year. Also, if we can't get this under control by 2050, the worldwide toll will be 10 million deaths a year (more than the current population of New York City).

The scale of antibiotic resistance seems overwhelming, but if you've ever bought a fluorescent light bulb because you were concerned about climate change, you already know what it feels like to take a tiny step to address an overwhelming problem. We could take those kinds of steps for antibiotic use too. We could forgo giving an antibiotic for our kids’ ear infection, if we're not sure it's the right one. And we could promise each other to never again to buy chicken or shrimp or fruit raised with routine antibiotic use. If we did those things, we could slow down the arrival of the post-antibiotic world.

They were impaled by an ox, shot and died in war, or maybe even died of starvation.\n\nWhile these things don't really happen as much in current day, there is a new threat to the lives of people. Antibiotic resistance. Antibiotics are used to treat infections caused by bacterial organisms. Penicillin was the first drug created to combat this sort of ailment. It has saved many lives over the years and many different types of antibiotics have been created to fight against different types of bacteria. Unfortunately however, these bacteria are starting to become resistant to this type of treatment. Antibiotic resistance is when bacteria become immune to an antibiotic rendering the drug useless. In the beginning this was a non issue, but as time progresses, more and more bacteria are starting to become resistant to these drugs.\n\nThere are steps that could be taken to decrease the odds of antibiotic resistance, but going at the current rate, there could be disastrous consequences if left unchanged. Currently there are around 50,000 in the United States alone that die due to bacterial infection that is resistant to antibiotics and when looking worldwide this number grows to 750,000. It's predicted that by 2050, this number will jump to a frightening 10 million deaths a year.\n\nWe can fight against antibiotic resistance by doing simple things such as choosing not to give our children antibiotics for a simple ear infection or refusing to eat chicken or other animals pumped full of antibiotics. With proper execution and changes, the fight against antibiotic resistance can be successful."",""generation"":0,""participant_id"":2}"
