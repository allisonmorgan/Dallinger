0,40,3,5,1,0,"Antibiotics were first discovered during World War II. During that time, they saved around 15% of our Allies. Over the years, over-use of antibiotics has caused our bodies to develop resistance to these medications. If we slow down the use of antibiotics then we may be able to reverse this in the future. "
0,40,3,1,1,0,"for most of history, people have died at relatively young ages due to events such as war, industrial accidents, and infections. It is only recently with the advances of modern medicine that people live longer lives, which has resulted in new problems such as death due to cancer and heart disease. In 1928, penicillin was discovered, which caused the shift from the pre-antibiotic world to life as we know it today using modern medicine. However, studies have shown that over the past 70 years since the discovery of antibiotics, that people have begun developing an immunity to the antibiotics. Diseases and infections have become resistive to anti-biotic treatments, rendering them ineffective. Researchers suggest that people limit their intake of anti-biotics, to prevent our bodies from developing an immunity to them. Practical steps such as not consuming poultry raised on anti-biotics and not giving our children anti-biotics for ear infections when it's unclear whether it will cure them are recommended."
0,40,3,15,1,0,"Throughout history, the passage is saying that long ago, we did not die of heart disease or of any of those ailmentsa and that is because of how things are being reproduced in the world today.  Years ago people died for being struck or from things such as that. The passage talks about antibiotic resistance and how it is used nowadays. "
0,40,3,8,1,0,"Penicillin was originally  developed in 1928 to fight bacterial infections.  Over time we have developed more antibiotics most with only a few side effects.  By fighting this bateria with our own lab-made bateria it helped eliminate diseases.  Over time there has been new superbugs which have defied the antibiotics altogether and many diseases are unable to be cured by antibiotics.  In the past people never lived long enough to die of such things as cancer, they were prematurely killed by infections that are curable today.  Comparing buying a light bulb to help with global warming is similair to the affects that our antibiotics have to these new superbugs.  It is just a drop in the water and not going to cure it in one swoop."
0,40,3,14,1,0,"In modern nations, people frequently die of heart disease and old age, while in earlier times, people frequently died of simple injuries such as being gored by an ox or wounded by machine created during the industrial revolution. Basic injuries used to cause infections which would lead to death. This changed because of penicillin.

Penicillin cures infections very well. It saved 12-15% of soldiers who fought in World War 2. Deaths from infection decreased all over the world.

But germs evolving, and antibiotics are losing their effectiveness. The germs have become so advanced that some companies have given up on trying to cure them. As a result, deaths from infections are starting to increase. Up to 700,000 people are expected to die from infections per year. If trends continue, up to 10 million could die to infections every year."
0,40,3,19,1,0,"In the days before the invention of antibiotics, people often died of accidents and the infections that came with them. When Alexander Flemming discovered penicillin, that changed and many more lives were saved, especially during WW2. 

The problem became that we started to use antibiotics with such frequency, that they have become ineffective to combat infections or ""superbugs"". Each year, scientist go back to the lab to try and tweak the antibiotic to fit the need, but now we are at the end and some bugs are resistant.

In order to lave 10 million lives in 2015, we must reduce the consumption of antibiotics in medicine form as well as food products."
0,40,3,17,1,0,"In 1928, Alexander Flemming discovered the antibiotic Penicillin. Prior to that time, people would die at a young age from injuries and infections obtained as a result of those injuries. They rarely lived long enough to develop cancers or other life threatening illnesses we think about today. Do to the introduction of antibiotics, people began to live longer. Antibiotics are considered to have saved between 12-15% of allied forces lives during WWII. These wonder drugs are now facing what may be the end of their use. There are new superbugs that are now developing, or bacteria that are resistant to antibiotics.  In the US and Great Britain it is estimated that 50,000 people die each year from infections that are antibiotic resistant. Of the 100 antibiotics out there, only 1 or 2 may help to treat these infections, and they might have serious side effects. It is estimated that about 700000 people world wide die from antibiotic resistant infections each year and this number may climb to 10,000,000 a year by 2050 if something is not done to curb this resistance. One thing we can to is to refuse antibiotics to treat ear infections if we are not sure that a bacteria is the cause or if the antibiotic is the right one. Also not eating meat that was raised with antibiotics is another thing that may help. These are small steps that we should take to help curb resistance and further development of these super bugs."
0,40,3,11,1,0,"throughout history most people have not died from heart attacks but rather accidents during the industrial revolution or farming accidents and because of this they did not reach ages where heart attack may be common. And one of the worst ways of dying was the infection. Before 1928 there was no cure, but fleming came across penicillin and this revolutized medicine. Saving lives especially during the war where many succumb to pneumonia. But now infections have been able to for a resistance to antibiotic and thus bringing back the era of death by infection. At least 50, 000 people die from infect in England and the U.S. 
World-wide the estimates are 700,000 dead from infection. We are able to fight these so called ""superbugs' by developing  drugs that can kill  them but every time one is discovered they are able to resist the antibiotic quickly.
If something is not done by the year 2050 the infection will reach epidemic proportions. There is a time to act just as we have with global warming and fluorescent lights. Something must be done."
0,40,3,25,1,0,"The most deaths through history were from infection caused by many different types of injury. During WWII however the discovery of antibiotics helped to reduce these types of deaths by 12-15%. Since then the over use of antibiotics has caused the existence of ""superbugs"" that are immune to the antibiotics. The number of deaths has increased to 700 thousand a year because of this and with the rate of increase could reach up to 10 million a year, which is roughly the population of New York. Reducing the use of antibiotics when ever possible is one small thing that can be done to prevent this increase."
0,40,3,21,1,0,"Throughout history most people didn't die from cancer or heart disease.  This is because they never lived long enough to develop those diseases.  Most of them were either gored to death by an ox, shot in the battlefield, killed in a factory or died as a result of an infection from those injuries.  

But with the discovery of antibiotics, that all changed.  It helped save people's lives.  That is until people started to become resistant to them because of overuse or eating animals that were given antibiotics.  The bacteria became stronger which turned into super bugs, making the antibiotic that used to work to kill a certain bacteria resistant."
0,40,3,23,1,0,"In centuries past, it used to be that people died mostly of infection and infectious diseases. That all changed when Alexander Fleming discovered penicillin and thus kickstarted the era of antibiotics Antibiotics, which are derived from the powerful substances bacteria generate to fight each other, have been saving lives ever since. But things are starting to change because of the resistance bacteria are starting to display against antibiotics. More and more, the medical world discovers new and improved bacteria which no antibiotics, or very few, can fight. And it's getting worse. Each year in the US and Europe, around 50,000 people die of antibiotic resistant bacterial infection, and around the world, that number goes up to 700,000. Medical researchers even forecast that if solutions are not found fast, by year 2050, around 10 million people could die each year from those infections. So being careful about using antibiotics sparingly is key. "
0,40,3,37,1,0,"Most people didn't live until old age not due to illness but due to injury-gored by an ox, or wounded in battle. Many of them died due to infection. Since the invention of pennicillin by Alexander Flemming there have been many less deaths. It's thought that 12-15% of soliders during world war 1 were saved due to the antibiotic. But as antibiotic became more plentiful bacteria has become more resistant to it and now there may be only one or none drugs that can cure illnesses from these superbugs. Perhaps we should not prescribe an antibiotic for a child's ear infection unless we know it's the right one. "
0,40,3,36,1,0,"People from years past didn't die from heart disease or cancer because they never lived that long to develop the diseases. They died from infections or accidents. They were shot or hurt when working in the manufacturing plants.

Alexander Fleming discovered penicillin and with that came a way to cure infections so that in the war the death rate dropped to 10-12% With this became a way for infections to be cured.

Now people are developing resistance to the drugs and now super bugs are happening because people are developing risks from the over use of penicillin. British studies show that if we don't find a cure for the super bacteria it will become a loss of over 700 million people. As many as the city of New York.

We can all make changes like we did when buying light bulbs because we were concerned with climate change. If we stopped giving antibiotics for ear infections or refusing to eat meat from animals that have been injected with antibiotics."
0,40,3,34,1,0,"In the past, we humans didn't die of cancer or heart disease; we didn't live long enough to develop those maladies. Instead we died from injuries, accidents on the job, and infections. But that changed in 1928 when Walther Flemming discovered humanities first antibiotic--penicillin. The discovery of penicillin was a game changer in terms of medicine and human lie expectancy. In fact, penicillin is credited for saving as much as 15% of the Allied forces from deadly infections during World War II.

But those golden days of effective antibiotics seems to be coming to an end. Bacteria that have develop resistant to our antibiotics have risen, and their growth had been rapid. Not, we are dealing with infection that only one or two drugs can treat, if any at all. The British government estimated that 700,000 people died of infection each year globally. That can rise to 10 million by 2050 if nothing is done.

The best way to to help slow down the rise of ""super bugs"" is to curtail our usage of antibiotics."
0,40,3,40,1,0,"People died over 70 years ago due to rampant infections, but Alexander Fleming created Penicillin in 1928 and a new era of antibiotics became known.  Antibiotics have saved lives, but the problem with the bacteria antibiotics are meant to treat is they have evolved over time.  They are fighting antibiotics and now there are ""superbugs"" that are killing people more than ever.  Out of about 100 antibiotics on the market, it may take one drug, or it may take a combination of two drugs with side effects to save a person from a superbug.  There are around 700,000 deaths a year now due to superbugs, and by 2050, there could be as many as 10 million deaths a year.  So, we need to begin changes now to combat this bleak future.  By not demanding antibiotics for every sore throat, or by not eating fruit or meat raised with antibiotics, we can help to reduce the superbugs from taking over. "
0,40,3,45,1,0,"In history, people have not died from heart disease or cancer. They didn't live long enough to develop these conditions. Instead, they would die from being shot on the battlefield, by an ox, or from infection. In 1928, Alexander Fleming invited the antibiotic penicillin. This helped improve conditions in World War II by 10-15%. This would save those who would typically die from sepsis or pneumonia on the battlefield. It was a golden age for medication. Now, there is a large concern for antibiotic resistant bacteria known as superbugs. For years, there has been a game of using an antibiotic against bacteria,and then having to continue to use other antibiotics again. Out of 100 available antibiotics, bacteria may only respond to 2, 1, or even 0 of these drugs available. Currently, 50 thousand people from the USA and UK die yearly from infections. It is estimated that 700 thousand die across the world from infection. And it is projected that by the 2050, 10 million people will die per year from infection if we continue to go down the path we are on. People can help lower these chances if they stop using antibiotics for their children's ear infection if they don't know the antibiotic will work, or by eating chicken and shrimp that isn't pumped full of antibiotics. Little steps will help slow the process. "
0,40,3,43,1,0,"Antibiotics are a great drug. They have been around since 1928 and have save a great quantity of lives. However, they are no longer providing the safety they once did because bacteria are mutating quickly. We are no longer able to provide an anitbiotic-even though there are at least 100 types available-for some superbugs or antibiotic resistant bacteria. By 2050 there is likely to be a crisis due to this. One way we can currently all participate in this crisis by not using antibiotics unless absolutely necessary."
0,40,3,55,1,0,"Throughout history most people did not die of cancer or heart disease, diseases that are common in the western world today. Most people did not live that long because they either died of injuries  but most died of infection. In 1928 Alexander flemming discovered penicillin a drug that is still in use to fight bacterial infections today. During World War 2 this drug saved ~15% of Allied lives. People are dying of infections again because of antibiotic resistant Superbugs. For the past 70 years we have been playing a game of leapfrog with bacteria and drugs and now bacteria gain resistance for fast that pharmaceutical companies no longer feel like developing new ones. Right now ~50000 people in the US and Europe die of infections that cannot be fought with drugs and by 2050 it will likely be 10 million deaths globally a year. "
0,40,3,47,1,0,"In the past, people did not die of the lifestyle influenced diseases like cancer or heart disease like they do today, mainly because they did not live long enouigh; they were more likely to die of being gored by an ox or crushed by a machine or from the infection that followed. In 1928 the discovery of penicillin helped to fight those types of infections and it was this drug that was responsible for saving the lives of 10-15% of servicemen during wwll. However, antibiotics have not been able to keep up with the the ""super"" bugs, today's form of viruses. It is estimated that 700,000 people will die worldwide due to infection and, if we do not learn to combat the viruses immunity to antibodies, that by 2050 ten million people could die. Small steps to fight the bugs immunity can be made by not over medicating. "

0,40,3,56,1,0,"Through history most people didn't die from cancer or heart disease, they died of injuries like being gored, shot or crushed. The infections were also a factor in many deaths until antibiotics were discovered. Penicillin was a thing and used to fight sepsis and pneumonia and it saved 12%-15% of Allied Forces lives. Then we had super bugs and had to make stronger antibiotics and stop buying food with routine antibiotic use."

The discover of antibiotics during the 1920's changed this dramatically.  With the discovery of penicillin, infections that were once lethal, now could be cured with a matter of days.  During WWII it was estimated that between 12-15% of wounded Allied troops were saved using antibiotics.  
Now, people are starting to die from bacteria infections once again because of a antibiotic resistance or super bugs.
Companies no longer want to manufacture antibiotics as they aren't profitable as bacteria quickly develop resistance. It is estimated that by the year 2050 over 10 million people will die from infection each year."
0,40,3,52,1,0,"Through the history people don't die because of cancer or heart disease, the lifestyle disease that are common in the western world today, mostly because people don't live long enough to develop them.

0,40,3,59,1,0,"Through history, most people didn't die from cancer or heart disease, common ailments that kill a majority of Westerns these days. People didn't live long enough to develop these diseases and instead died due to injuries, war, famine, and infections. It wasn't until a miracle of sorts occurred and penicillin was discovered in 1928 that saved a large amount of people. And now the opposite is happening: antibiotic use has become so prevalent, infections are becoming ""super"" and have much resistance to the use of antibiotics."
0,40,3,51,1,0,"Throughout history people didn't die of heart disease or cancer, the common lifestyle diseases of today. This is because they often didn't live long enough to develop them.

This all changed when Alexander Flemming discovered Penicillin in 1928. Using this drug, we were able to combat infections using bacteria's own biological mechanisms against them. In World War II it was used to treat pneumonia and sepsis and is thought to have saved the lives of over 10 percent of the allied forces.
Recently however, bacteria have been gaining resistance to many of the antibiotics we have used in the past. We have been leapfrogging, developing new antibiotics to use when the bacteria become resistant to old ones. It would be easy to assume that this is a problem only in developing countries, but it is also an enormous problem in the United States as well. A UK research firm has predicted that the worldwide deaths from antibiotic resistant bacterial infections could be as high as 10 million by 2050 if nothing is done to combat this epidemic.
There are some things that an individual can do to help slow the development of antibiotic resistant strains of bacteria. It is as simple as not using antibiotics for infections unless you are sure they are the correct one or not purchasing grocery products that have been produced with antibiotic treatments."

The cause of death from these was usually infection. Previously, an infection knocked out 12-15% of the Allied Forced. But then, penicilin was discovered and infections that would previously be a death sentence we now gone within days.

However, antibiotic overuse has caused bacteria to mutate and become resistant to drugs. Now, more people are dying from infections again because they can't be treated with traditional drugs anymore. Experts estimate that 10 million people will die from antibiotic resistant infections by 2050. 

Do your part by forgoing the antibiotics for your kid's ear infection and doesn't eat meat that has been raised with antibiotics. "
0,40,3,65,1,0,"Throughout history, most people did not die of heart disease or cancer. This was due to the fact that most people did not live long enough to develop these diseases. Instead, most people died from injuries; specifically, infections following injuries. This changed in 1928, when Alexander Fleming discovered penicillin, the first antibiotic. Penicillin was found to kill the bacteria within injuries, stopping infection in saving lives. This was a turning point in modern medicine. In fact, penicillin is believed to have saved 12-15% of Allied lives in World War II. However, infections are once more becoming a problem due antibiotic resistance. In a natural environment, bacteria compete for resources, often evolving to out-perform their competitors. This evolution often allows bacteria to change to such a degree that they become immune to known antibiotics. When our commonly-used antibiotics no longer work, there is no recourse for an infection and it often results in death. While this may seem like a rare occurrence, in fact, over 50,000 people die in the United States each year from untreatable infections due to antibiotic-resistant bacteria. If not dealt with, it is estimated that by 2050 over 10 million people will have died of similar infections, which is higher than the population of New York City. There are solutions, however, the main being the adoption of more judicious antibiotic use. That is, using them only when absolutely needed, and using the correct kind, as well as refraining from eating foods that used antibiotics during the growing phase. "

It was so effective that it was estimated to have saved 12 to 15% of Allied Forces during World War II. However, now the golden age of anti-biotics is coming to an end.

After decades of anti-biotic use, bacteria are now growing increasingly resistant to anti-biotics. As a result, the number of people dying from infections is increasing. For 70 years, pharmaceutical companies have been playing leapfrog with bacteria: The companies create a new anti-biotic, the bacteria grows resistant to it, the companies produce a new anti-biotic. But now the bacteria is evolving so quickly that pharmaceutical companies no longer see the development of anti-biotics as a good investment. If nothing is done, in 2050 there could be 10 million deaths a year from bacterial infections.

Every one can play a small part in fighting anti-biotic resistant by not using anti-biotics when unnecessary and not supporting companies that use anti-biotics to raise animals."
0,40,3,74,1,0,"In the past, many people did not die from the same issues we have nowadays, lifestyle diseases such as heart disease. This was because people did not live long enough to develop them. Instead, they died from other things such as injuries- being gored by a bull for instance. Then these injuries could develop infections which ultimately were life-threatening.

This changed when penicillin was discovered. With this, people were able to help the infections which led to many fewer people dying from such situations. [there were also a couple statistics here but I can't remember them, I believe they were regarding WWII?]

However, all this is changing nowadays due to antibiotic-resistance. We have been playing a game of leap-frog with bacteria: developing antibiotics to kill certain bacteria, those bacteria developing a resistance, then developing antibiotics to deal with those resistant bacteria, etc. This is a serious issue to the point where an international group has been created to determine the effects of antibiotic resistant bacteria. Hundreds of thousands of people die yearly from this and if we don't curb the problem, we may end up by 2050 dealing with over a million deaths due to this (more than the population of New York City).

It may seem a serious issue but as anyone who has bought a florescent bulb to help curb their effects on climate change know, even a small step can lead to big changes. Something as simple as not giving your child antibiotics for an ear infection if they do not know which antibiotic would be helpful, or promising to not eat any meat/dairy that comes from animals treated with antibiotics can help."

Penicillin was used to fight bacterial infections which helped the Allied Forces and save many soldiers lives.  Doctors continued to use penicillin and other bacteria-fighting medicines to treat infections.  However, over the years, many different strains of bacteria have mutated and adapted to current bacteria-fighting medicines.  These strains of bacteria were nicknamed ""superbugs"". Every time a new superbug was formed, a new medicine was created to fight the new bacterial strain.

People are dying of infections again because of antibiotic resistance.

However, the age of antibiotics is coming to an end. Bacteria are growing more and more resistant to antibiotics, so much that some pharmaceutical companies deem it pointless to manufacture antibiotics. As a result, deaths from infections are spreading around the world. These bacteria that resist antibiotics are called ""superbugs"", and it has become a huge problem in our world today.

Unfortunately, over the many years of using penicillin and other antibiotics excessively, we have created ""superbugs."" Superbugs are diseases that are resistant to antibiotics, they became that way due to adapting to our treatments, specifically when we use them too much or when they're not really needed. There are many deaths around the world each year due to diseases that resist antibiotics, and that number is only expected to rise in coming years unless we take action to avoid the outcome now."

This changed with the introduction of antibiotics during the Second World War, where they saved the lives of many soldiers that otherwise would have died of disease or infection.

Since then we have been living in a golden age of medicine, but one supported by a game of leapfrog between modern medicine and bacteria, where each drug is eventually resisted by evolution in diseases, then countered by new drugs. As more diseases become resistant, drug companies have become less interested in developing new antibiotics, however, and now there are many diseases that are resisted by two drugs with side-effects, or one, or zero.

Many people think of this problem as being restricted to less developed parts of the world, but it's a concern everywhere. In the United States and Europe, 50,000 people a year die to diseases that can no longer be treated, and 700,000 worldwide. (Someone) estimates that if that trend continues, that number will rise to 10 million a year by 2050.

Experience with environmental problems has taught us that we do not need to solve this in one fell swoop, however. Small changes can make a difference. We can consider whether or not we are using the correct drugs responsibly for minor problems like a child's ear infection. We can avoid eating foods like chicken or shrimp that have been raised using an excess of antibiotics. By doing so, we can slow the advance of resistant diseases."
