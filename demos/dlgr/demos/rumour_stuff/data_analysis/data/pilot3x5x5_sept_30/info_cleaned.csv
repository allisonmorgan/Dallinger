0,3,2,0,4,"Since 1928, when penicillin was first introduced, we have had a hold on infections that had took so many lives before. Now, super bugs and resistence to antibiotics, have more people are dying. We need to not give antibiotics out for every little sneeze or sniffle. It is making it much harder to fight the bacteria and if we are not careful, by 2050 more people than New York City will be dying. "
0,3,5,0,2,"through history, people did not die of heart disease and cancer, and other despises common today. Most people died before they could develop them. People died in war or in accidents. Many people died of infections as well.
once penicillin was discovered people began making antibiotics and a lot of people were saved. 
for 100 years we have been making new antibiotics to fight bacteria, but recently bacteria have become resistant to all of our antibiotic drugs. hundreds of thousand people a year die from resistant bacteria, and by 2050 the numbers could be in the millions per year. "
0,3,8,0,2,Antibiotics are reaching the end of their effectiveness. For years humans have used antibiotics for every infection and the bacteria have started developing resistances to it. Now they are starting to become resistant to all antibiotics which is causing people to die from infections that were once under control. We can curb this by slowing down our use of antibiotics which will hopefully also slowdown the rate of adaption by bacterial microbes.
0,3,7,0,3,This passage was the pro's and con's of medicine. This is really about humans becoming anti resistant to antibotics and the effects it can have by 2050 we could lose up to 10 million people.
0,3,12,0,4,"antiobiotics were not around in the past so people died of injuries, but now antibiotics have been invented by Fleming and it can cure a lot of things that were killing people. But there has been superbugs that resist antibiotics so now it seems like the time for antibiotics is ending and the world populiation will die at a rate of 10 million per year"
0,3,14,0,2,"Hundreds of years ago people didn't die of common causes today such as cancer and heart disease. They died from injuries, from battle or from infections from bacteria.

Pharmaceutical companies develop antibiotics to deal with bacteria infections. However, bacteria are able to gain resistance to these infections. This could lead to a future epidemic by the year 2050. Currently there are 700,000 deaths per year due to this epidemic. But it is estimated that if this isn't controlled that could skyrocket to 10 million per year."
0,3,26,0,4,"In the olden days, people wouldn't die of cancer or heart disease like we do today, mostly because they didn't live long enough to develop those diseases. They would die by being crushed in industrial accidents in one of the few factories around at that time, or mauled to death by an ox or from injury or infection. Since the development of antibiotics in 1928, people have lived a lot longer becuase we could treat those infections with this new regimen. 12-15% of allied soldiers were estimated to be saved from infection using antibiotics. We are now seeing a reversal of that after 70 years. Our bodies are becoming resistant to the antibiotics and a lot of the drugs will no longer work. An estimated 50 thousand people die from infections worldwide currently and if we don't figure out how to reverse this trend, by 2050 10 Million people, the population of New York City are estimated to die every year. We can take small steps now to prevent this by not using antibiotics for every little ear infection and things like that to prevent the build up of resistance to these life saving drugs."
0,3,18,0,1,"The leading cause of death throughout history has primarily been due to injuries and infection. While this went away after antibiotics were invented, deaths from infection are on the rise because bacteria continue to evolve to combat the vaccines we develop. Now bacteria evolve so quickly that it isn't financially worth it to companies to keep developing new strains of antibiotics."
0,3,19,0,0,"Historically, humans did not live long enough to die from things like cancer, heart failure, etc. Many people died after receiving injuries - whether animal wounds from hunting, or being crushed by rocks, or war wounds, or factory accidents - and the infections that followed those injuries.
But after penicillin was discovered in the early 20th century by Mr. Fleming, infections became possible to treat. Infections that once killed people, could now be cured within days, and easily. This resulted in a dramatic number of lives saved during World War I; somewhere between 10-15% of Allied forces by some estimates. Death from infections dropped dramatically everywhere.
But this is now changing. Bacteria evolve and develop resistances to antibiotic drugs, and for decades companies were constantly developing new drugs to kill bacteria as they became resistant to old ones. And now there are ""superbugs"" - types of bacteria that are immune to most, if not all, available antibiotics. And pharmaceutical companies are finding it too hard to develop new drugs. Already some 700,000 peopel a year are dying by infections worldwide, and if a solution isn't found by 2050 that number could rise to 10,000,000 a year - about the population of NYC.
There may come a day when only one or two, or no drugs at work on a given infection. And one way to combat this is by reducing our antibiotic use. Don't prescribe antibiotics to common childhood illnesses like earaches if we are not certain it is the right drug, don't buy or eat foods raised with animal treated with antibiotics, and other similar actions."
0,3,20,0,0,"Back then, people didn't die from cancer or heart disease, they didn't live long enough to experience these problems as they were killed by animals, died in the war, or were killed in factory jobs. When antibiotics came into the picture, this led to saving millions of lives, especially for the allied forces in WWII. This penicillin is even used today. But now people have begun to die again because of resistance to antibiotics. This includes MRSA and many other strains of bacterium. The weaker organism dies off, but the survivors come back even stronger than before leading to a back and forth between the two until we reach our inevitable outcome in a post-antibiotic world. Even pharmaceuticals companies want no stake in this losing war."
0,3,23,0,3,"People in the past died of different things. Most of the time they died from injury and infection. In the early 1900s this changed dramatically with the invention of new medicines and techniques. But now theres antibiotic resistant bacteria, which is really dangerous. Lots more people could die in the future if we don't figure it out. We should probably stop overusing antibiotics."
0,3,24,0,1,"Through history people died for lots of reasons, but then Alexander Fleming discovered penicillin, which helped fight bacterial infections. The problem is now bacteria are evolving to beat antibiotics and people are dying from less treatable infections. You can take small steps, the way one does for the environment by using a fluorescent light bulb, to fight the rise of the superbugs by not using antibiotics when unnecessary."
0,3,22,0,1,"The discovery of penicillin by Alexander Flemming changed the world and the way we treat infections. Penicillin is still used today as an antibiotic and prompted the development of hundreds more. Flemming's discovery aided in World War II, reducing Allied deaths by 10-15%. Antibiotics have also allowed people to live far longer than in the past. People used to die from injury, or infection, but due to this prolonged longevity, we are now dying from lifestyle diseases like heart disease.

The current number of worldwide deaths due to infection is around 700,000 and is actually anticipated to only rise. By 2050, the estimated toll will be around 10 million. Why? Antibiotic resistance or the rise in ""superbugs"" renders current antibiotics useless and allows bacteria to thrive. The use of antibiotics is like a game of leapfrog; as we develop new antibiotics, the bacteria become resistant, so we develop new drugs, and so on. These bacteria will only continue to develop resistance against antibiotics if we continue to overuse antibiotics. We need to cut back on our use of antibiotics for every little ailment, or soon this problem will be out of control."
0,3,25,0,0,"Throughout most of human history, people did not typically die from heart disease or cancers. The died young from gun shot wounds, factory accidents, falling off a horse, or (most of the time) from infections, as a result of those injuries. 

Death by infection forever changed in the 1920's when antibiotics were discovered. Millions of lives have been saved in the decades since and people are living longer lives. But antibiotic resistance is gaining considerable ground and we are becoming more at risk of death by bacteria. ""Superbugs"" have been getting worse and killing many people. The problem is expected to worsen. Currently in the U.S. and Europe, about 50,000 people die a year from infections that cannot be treated. That number is expected to rise to 10 million a year by 2050, unless we can do something to stop it.

Tiny steps can be taken now to help stave off disaster later, like not taking unnecessary antibiotics or not consuming meats raised on antibiotics. "
1,3,29,0,4,"Antibiotics were a miracle that revolutionized the treatment of different infections.  Their use has saved countless millions of lives in the last 100 or so years.  However, we've overused antibiotics, and now many bacteria have evolved or adapted to be resistant to their use.  We're creating new super antibiotics, but we also need to drastically cut the use of older antibiotics.  "
1,3,27,0,1,"Death from injury and infections is much less than it was before Alexander Fleming discovered penecillian. Today 700,000 people die every year from infection. But experets predict that by the year 2050 10,000,000 people every year will die from infection. This is because bateria continually develop resistance to antibiotics. Overuse of antibiotics causes this. The best thing people can do to help is not use antibiotics unless it is neccessary."
1,3,30,0,3,In the past people died of infections and injuries that let to infections. In the early 1900s with the discovery of antiboitics the rate of death from infection went significantly down. Unfortunately the overuse of antibiotics has lead to bacteria become more and more resistant to them. Unless we find a way to fix this it could mean up to 10 million deaths in 2050 because of what mainly is overuse of antibiotics causing these resistant strains of bacteria.
1,3,31,0,2,"Throughout history most people did not die from the common diseases seen today such as heart disease and cancer. many did not live long enough to develop these illnesses because they died in war, in accidents, or from more common infections. Once we discovered penicillin and other antibiotics, less people died from these infections. However, the more we use antibiotics, the more antibiotic resistant diseases show up. Scientists estimate that these diseases could cause up to 10 million annual deaths by 2050 if we do not do something about it soon. "
1,3,33,0,4,"Antibiotics have saved countless lives throughout the years since there invention, however, they are begining to be less effective due to over use and over perscribing them for small infections that the body can most of the time take care of on their own. If something isn't done to change this millions will start to die every year due to antibiotic resistant infections."
1,3,37,0,1,antibodies have in the past reduced deaths related to infections. Now diseases have become resistant to the antibodies and deaths are on the rise due to these new superbugs becoming more and more resistant to the antibodies. fluorescent light treatment is one way of combating disease resistant antibodies
1,3,34,0,0,"The gist of all three stories presented was about antibiotics and how since the invention of the penicillan vaccine it has saved many lives. Yet, because of over use of antibiotics there are ""superbugs"" making infections resistant to antibiotics due to over use. All three stories changed in what year or decade they used as evidence for when the antibiotic was introduced. The first story said it was invented around WWI and used to save countless soldiers, the next said it was the 1920s, and another said it was WWII era. Overall, it was noted that by 2050 there is a possibility of ten million people who could die if antibiotics are not perfected. "
1,3,36,0,0,"before the advent of antibiotics people used to die from injuries caused by accidents gunshot wounds etc. Since antibiotics were discovered many lives have been saved including thousands on the battlefields. Over use of antibiotics has however lead to an increase in superbugs, these are bacteria that are resistant to many different antibiotics or even all of them. "
1,3,35,0,3,"People in the past had high number of mortality from infection. This changed tremendously with the advancement of medicine and techniques. The more availability of medicine and the higher dosages sadly did lead to bacteria having resistance to antibiotics. Now, more people are susceptible to super bacteria and if nothing is done to combat that problem. We could all die in the near future from having super resistant bacteria."
3,3,63,0,0,Using too many antibiotics could create a superbug and antibiotics won't be helpful anymore. We will be immune to antibiotics by 2050
1,3,38,0,2,"Thanks to advances in medicine and science we're living longer today than we ever have before.  Some of the greatest threats to our survival hundreds of years ago are trivial in the modern era of medicine and antibiotics, but it's this same triumph of modern medicine that may take us back to suffering from those problems once again.

As we've gotten more and more accustomed to using antibiotics as our first line of defense against bacteria and infections, so too have those ailments gotten more accustomed to fighting back.  We are seeing an ever-growing number of cases in which bacteria is able to resist everything we throw at it, and this is leading to more and more people losing their lives to things that many assumed we had conquered.  Current projections for the impact of this issue are not looking optimistic, but if we act now and start taking precautions like avoiding the overuse of antibiotics when they aren't necessary we may be able to slow down this issue until we can make another breakthrough to keep the bacteria at bay."
1,3,39,0,0,"For much of recorded history people didn't die of things like cancer or heart disease.  Most people died from accidents or injuries incurred while doing things like hunting, working outside, or factory work; and the subsequent infections incurred from such accidents.  That all changed in the 1920's with the discovery of pencillin and the evolution of antibiotic drugs.  Now, infectious bacteria are becoming antibiotic resistant though.  Currently thousands of people die each year from infections that are immune to treatment by antibiotics.  That is expected to rise to millions of people by the year 2050.  "
1,3,41,0,1,"Alexander Fleming discovered anitibotics which helped reduced numerous deaths throughout the ages due to infection. Although anitibiotics have saved millions of lives, infections are spreading because the bacteria are becoming resistant due to evolution. It is imperative to use antibiotics only when necessary."

1,3,42,0,2,"For most of history, we have focused on treating disease with anitbiotics.  But thru time, the antibiotics have evolved and our original treatments are no longer effective.  We need to stop immediately prescribing antibiotics and let our bodies fight it initially"
2,3,45,0,0,"The overuse of antibiotics has created a potential problem. Infections are a relatively new problem in human history. War and death by accident or injuries accounted for a greater number of deaths. 

People are now becoming immune/resistant to the antibiotics. 'Superbugs' is a potential rising epidemic with the possibility that millions who could die due to being immune to treatment."
2,3,51,0,1,"Thanks to  Alexander Fleming , the inventor of penicillin,  millions of people survive being infected by bacteria. Unfortunately, bacteria are a constantly adapting entity and inevitability will be penicillin resistant. Science predicts in 2050 700,000 people will die due to these mutated bacteria nicknamed 'super bugs.'  Currently, scientist and medical professions all utilizing special lights to kill these bacteria. People can help combat super bugs by only taking antibiotics when they are necessary."
2,3,57,0,1,"Even though only 700,000 people die from infections, that number is supposed to rise to 10,000,000 by 2050. The reason for the dramatic increase is bacteria's ability to evolve and become resistant to the current antibodies we have currently. These super bugs are resistant to the antibodies and render them useless. The is why it is important it use antibodies only when absolutely necessary.    "
2,3,60,0,3,"The creation of antibiotics helped reduce the amount of infection related deaths.  This came with a drawback, however.  Bacteria is becoming resistant to antibiotics, and at this rate 10 million will die by 2050 from antibiotic resistant bacteria.  "
3,3,74,0,1,"Over the years people have been able to survive illnesses due to the medicine penicillin but, due to disease-causing bacteria gaining resistance, that soon may not be enough anymore. By 2050, death from infectious diseases may jump to 10,000,000 (from the current 700,000) by 2050. The best way to slow down this resistance is by encouraging everyone to only resort to antibiotics when needed and to practice prevention."
1,3,43,0,4,"Throughout history, mankind has been susceptible to injury and death by misadventure, occupational hazards, and a host of infections and diseases. Many people never reached old age due to death from common sicknesses. Once Fleming's invention of antibiotics were introduced, illnesses and injuries that would have killed before were now able to be treated. However, as time has progressed, our bodies have adapted and so have the diseases. We are starting to see extensive evidence of drug-resistant bugs, which could be the result of overuse of antibiotics. If something does not change in the way we prescribe and use these drugs, it is estimated that by the year 2050, as many as 10 million people a year could die to drug-resistant illnesses. That's the equivalent of the population of New York City."
2,3,47,0,3,"In earlier times people would die from infections and injuries (that led to infections), but the rise of antibiotics drastically reduced the rate of death. Unfortunately, overuse of these antibiotics has caused bacteria to become resistant to their effects (super resistant) and if we don't control it then up to 10 million people could die in 2050 as a result of these resistant strains of bacteria which no longer respond to the typically given antibiotics."

2,3,48,0,2,"Thanks to achievements in medicine and antibiotics, people are living longer today than in the past.  The drawback to this, however, is that bacteria is becoming resistant to antibiotics, making them stronger, and creating a potential future threat that could take us back to the same historical level of potential danger.  Also, aging allows other things, such as cancer, to become more prevalent, since people are now able to live longer, making the chances of such things increase."

Unfortunately, we began taking antibiotics for minor infections that our bodies were capable of healing on their own.  This practice has created new antibiotic resistant diseases. Creating new super strength antibiotics to combat these diseases is not enough, we also have to stop prescribing antibiotics for small infections and allow our bodies to once again fight them on their own.  If we do not act immediately it is estimated that by 2050 nearly 10 million people per year will die from drug resistant infections."

2,3,56,0,2,"Before the invention of penicillin and other antibiotics that followed, a human's life expectancy was often much shorter. It was uncommon for people to die from things like heart disease because most people would not live that long. Instead, more common but today less deadly ailments could be far worse without a method of treatment. On top of that, germ theory was not well understood for much of human history, and that made preventive measures impossible.

Today people generally don't need to fear most bacterial infections. However, many bacteria have begun to adapt to our poisons. If we don't move on the issue of antibiotic-resistance, we may well find ourselves returning to a period of much shorter life expectancies"
