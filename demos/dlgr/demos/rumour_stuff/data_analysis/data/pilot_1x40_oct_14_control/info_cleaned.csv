In those times humans died from injury's and infections at younger ages than they do now. This all changed in 1924 when antibiotics were invented. It cured most of the Barrie infections that had plagued humans for centuries. However as time has went on infections have gotten immune to most antibiotic diseases. So we are potentially entering in a age of time where more and more people die from these diseases. The only way to combat this is to not eat food raised on antibiotics and to only use the proper antibiotic for what is bothering you."

We are lucky to have been living in the golden age of antibiotics, where most bacterial infections could be easily defeated with an antibacterial drug.  For 70 years bacteria have been adapting to the drugs that we have sent to kill them and now antibacterial resistant bacteria are on the rise.  Drug companies have stated that solving this issue is not profitable enough and so it is quite likely that bacterial infections will again become a large cause of death.  You can take a small step to help by not taking antibiotics when you don't need them or by not eating food that was given unneeded antibiotics."

This overuse has created bacteria which is immune to the life saving antibiotic drugs and the number of these ""superbugs"" continue to grow.

All that changed in 1928 when penicillin was discovered by Alexander Fleming to treat bacterial infections. Penicillin meant that infections could be treated and cleared up instead of killing the person who had it.

Today, people are starting to die again because infections are starting to become antibiotic resistant. We are now back to thousands of people dying a year due to infections that cannot be killed by existing antibiotics and this number is predicted to increase significantly in the coming years."

This changed when antibiotics were discovered by a man named Fleming. Suddenly people were living longer, because the antibiotics fought off the bacterial infections.

Over time, unfortunately, bacteria has developed resistance to antibiotics. Because of this, we are now entering an age where, despite there being 100 antibiotics at hand, it's possible only one will work, or perhaps even none.

Eventually our world may not have any antibiotics that work against superbugs that have developed resistance to all antibiotics. After that, we will be living in a world somewhat like we did before. Already, about 700,000 people die per year from infections. Eventually it may be 10 million."
0,40,1,9,0,0,"Cancer and heart disease weren't an issue many years ago.  That is because people didn't live long enough to develop those problems.  They were more likely to die from injuries from farming, or in the factories that were available when the Industrial Revolution began.  People would often die from infections that came after a serious injury.

In 1928, antibiotics were developed.  Thanks to antibiotics, people began recovering in a few days from an illness that used to be a death sentence.  We were living longer, healthier lives.

However, now bacteria are getting better at fighting back and some have become resistant to the antibiotics we have been using.  It has become much more difficult to fight infections that are resistant, so people are again dying from them.  By 2050, it's estimated there may be 10 million deaths due to superbug infections.

We may be able to slow it down by not taking antibiotics when it may nor be necessary.  We can also stop eating food that comes from animals that were treated with anibiotics."
0,40,1,1,0,0,"Hundreds of years ago life expectancy was incredibly low, most due to people dying from injuries sustained from oxen, every day work and mostly due to infection.  In 1928 Alexander Fleming discovered penicillin which treated a multitude of infections and drastically decreased deaths due to infection.  It was used to treat pneumonia and sepsis and during world war 2 it is estimated that it saved 12-15% of allied forces.

Unfortunately, because we rely so very heavily on antibiotics the infections and diseases are becoming resistant to antibiotics becoming antibiotic resistant or, more commonly known as, super bugs.  The bacteria is developing resistances so quickly that pharmaceutical companies have come to the conclusion that it is just no longer in their best interest to continue making them.  Infections have started moving across the world for which, out of more than 100 common antibiotics on the market, 2 of those drugs MIGHT work but have side effects.  One of those might work or even none of them.  Fifty thousand people a year succumb to infections that no drug can help.  Reviews on antimicrobial resistance estimate that there are nearly 700 thousand deaths a year.  It is estimated that, if we can not get this under control then by 2050 the death toll could be at nearly ten million deaths a year, far larger than the current population of New York city.  

The absolute scale of antibiotic resistance seems so very overwhelming, but with little steps we can combat it, much like how people by fluorescent lights to combat environmental issues.  Stop treating the childrens ear infection with an antibiotic you're not even sure will work."
0,40,1,27,0,0,"People used to die often from injuries more than they did from preventable illness, because of a lack of effective medical scientific technology. This changed when Alexander Flemming discovered the antibiotic penicillin around the time of World War II. People were suddenly dying from infections far less often. Now, however, because of the race between pharmaceutical science and bacteria, antibiotics are becoming less and less effective. To prevent this from escalating any further, the public needs scale back the used of antibiotics in non-necessary or life threatening situations. "
0,40,1,15,0,0,"In the world most of the deaths are not caused by cancer or any other kind of diseases like that but rather most deaths are due to infections cause by an accident in an industry or somethings like that. But in 1928 after Dr. Fleming discovered the penicillin it all changed. The bacterial infections which once took too many lives are now cured just within days. The way it works is that the bacteria fight among others to survive on the food and our drugs like penicillin was the resistance to it. It all went well until today, because now the bacteria has evolved so drastically that the current pharmaceutical companies aren't able to make a resistance drug which is feasible to use. As of today, more than 50,000 people die due to infections and the total death toll of the world is around 700,000 people every year. If something is not done to find a solution to it, it is predicted that the total worldwide death toll will reach to 10 million people by 2050, which is in fact more people than New York City as of today. Just as we changed ourselves to use fluorescent lights as a small step to fight against global warming, we can also take small steps like this to prevent death from infections.

That changed when antibiotics were discovered in 1928 and penicillin which is a drug people still use today. Now people are dying because of a rare condition that does not allow their bodies to absorb the antibiotics given to them because of what they are calling superbugs. For a very long time we played around with the appearance and disappearance of bacteria, but it is getting stronger now. These occurrences are not natural and about 50,000 people in the US and Europe die from infections that cannot be helped by drugs.

But then, in 1928, Fleming discovered antibiotics, and then the routine deaths from simple things could now be remedied after just a few days. We have been overusing these antibiotics by giving them for any infection. Bacteria compete for food sources, and develop resistance. There are around one hundred antibiotics, but only one or two will work for any given infection.They are proving to be ineffective more and more for fighting infections. Soon, people will be dying by the millions because of this resistance. We need to stop giving an antibiotic that will not work to prevent not having any useful antibiotics in the future."
0,40,1,34,0,0,"Way back when, people used to die of many different things, and there was no such thing as antibiotics or other drugs that could kill basic diseases or issues that we have today. A dude created penicillin in the early 1900s, and after it was created, many people were saved from things they may have died from before, including soldiers that were hurt in the war. However, as it continued to grow, more antibiotics were created, and people were given them for anything and everything, and sometimes they didnt even need them. And additionally, companies started to use them in meats and such. So we should actually be really careful about what we use antibiotics for, because it can be making things worse and we can't always use antibitocis if its not the right thing to treat something."

Once antibiotics (mainly penicillin) was developed, this treated infections, but allowed people to live longer and develop these diseases. As the antibiotic movement picked up, the health industry began to leap frog with different conditions. Once one condition was addressed with an antibiotic, another condition was developed. Currently the development of different conditions is snowballing so much that by the year 2050, nearly 10 million people will die a year.

This development is said to have saved up to 20% of military participants. For a long time we were living under the the safe magical umbrella of antibiotics.  Unfortunately, bacteria, also known as ""Super bugs,"" are becoming resistant to many types of bacteria.  So fast on fact that modern medicine cant keep up.  If we don't  get a hold of this problem, we could be looking at 10,000 deaths per year to do antibiotic resistant bacteria by 2050. Even though it looks like a huge problem to tackle, we can still take the steps needed to begin to tackle the problem.

In the US/Europe 50000 people die each year from antibiotic resistant infections and around 700000 year world wide. By 2050, if things don't change, the number will likely increase to 10 million a year. There are things we could do to delay or halt this.

0,40,1,50,0,0,"In prior periods of history, diseases that we currently die from such as cancer did highly contribute to deaths. This is because people did not live long enough to contract these illnesses. They died by being gored by an ox, shot in war, or from injuries during the Industrial revolution. Mostly, they died of infection developed from these things. 

Alexander discovered penicillin in 1823 (?) which used the toxins that bacteria create against themselves. However, bacteria are able to adapt to antibiotics, so a leap frog system takes place. We are now incapable of keeping track of the speed with which bacteria can adapt. Pharmaceutical companies no longer feel it is worth the expense to create drugs that won't work. For any illness, maybe 2-3 or even only 1 will work. 

By 2050, if this problem is not solved, 10 million deaths a year (the population of NYC), will occur because of resistance to antibiotics or ""superbugs"".

You might think it's as useless as buying a flourescent light bulb to fight climate change, but being careful about antibiotic use at the personal level can make a difference.

Unfortunately we are coming to the end of the age where things like penicillin will be saving us.

People are starting to die again because of antibiotic resistance A.K.A. superbugs. Bacteria create lethal compounds to kill each other when they compete for resources and we took those compounds and engineered them for our own devices. For 70 years we played a game with these bacteria of make a new antibiotic and they start to resist it, but now we're running out of antibiotics. They develop resistances so fast that it's not in our best interest to keep making antibiotics. If this  continues we could see annual deaths of 10 million a year by 2050. As of right now between just the US and Europe, 50 thousand people die a year and worldwide its around 700 thousand.

The sheer magnitude of antibiotic resistance seems very scary, but if you've tried to do small things to help the environment then you understand what it's like to take baby steps. We can do something similar with antibiotics as well. Simple things like making sure not to buy animal products grown on regular antibiotic treatments or deciding against using an antibiotic when we don't know if it'll work for a simple thing like an ear infection are things that can help. At the very least this would slow down the coming world of antibiotic resistant bacteria becoming unstoppable."
