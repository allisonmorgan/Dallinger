0,5,0,"Most people in the past didn't die from heart disease because they didn't live long enough to develop it. Alexander Fleming developed Penicillin in 1928. It saved between 12-15% of soldiers' lives in World War II. The golden age is coming to an end. Antibiotic resistance causes superbugs that respond to two, one or even none of the hundred antibiotics we have. By 2050 it could claim 10 million lives, more than the population of New York City."
0,6,6,"Early on many people did not die of heart disease or strokes or anything, they died because of infections. Most everybody that got injured eventually got an infection and died. In the early 1900s, Alexander Fleming discovered penicillin and that it would fight most bacterial infections. Pencil has saved many lives. However, it comes with its own set of problems. Over the years viruses have mutated and have become immune to many antibiotics they are called ""superbugs"". So we create stronger antibiotics and then the superbugs become even stronger. This goes back-and-forth until sometime in the future, the bacteria will win. Heavy use of antibiotics in livestock also increases our resistance to the very antibiotics that are supposed to help us."
0,2,1,"In the old days, people didn't die of cancer or heart disease or other modern illnesses because they didn't live long enough. They died from being gored by an ox or mangled by a wagon accident and the resulting infection.  Then penicillin was discovered in 1927 and infections no longer killed people. But over time, bacteria have become resistant to penicillin and the derivatives that pharmaceutical companies research and develop. And the bacteria are evolving faster than the researchers can keep up with. So now, people are once again dying from infections for which we have no cure. And the pace is increasing. If we don't address the issue and stop over-using antibiotics by 2050, more people will die from infections than the entire population of NYC."
0,4,3,In the past people didn't die of the diseases that are common today.  They didn't live long enough to develop them.  They died of an injury or an infection.  That changed when antibiotics were discovered by Alexander Fleming.  Now infections that were once a death sentence were no longer that.  Now people are dying again because of antibiotic resistance.  For years we played a game of trying to find drugs to treat these diseases and fight the resistance.  It seems overwhelming to deal with antibiotic resistance but you have to keep taking steps to address it.
0,19,9,"While antibiotics have been used to fight bacterial infections for 90 years, their effectiveness may be coming to an end. ""Superbugs"" are developing that are more resistant to traditional antibiotics.  If we want to maximize the effective ness of antibiotics we can do things like not eat meats or vegetables that have been treated with antibiotics. "
1,27,0,Most people didn't live long enough to experience heart problems. When Penicillin was invented it helped save and extend lives. However resistance to the antibiotics is growing and there are now super bugs that barely respond to any antibiotics if they do actually respond. These can potentially wipe out most of the city of New York.
2,47,8,"People in the past didn't die of cancer because they didn't live long enough to get it. Before antibiotics, people would die quickly of infection. The invention of penicillin has saved many lives, including 12-15% of the allies in WW1. Now, penicillin is overused, creating resistant bacteria known as superbugs. People should try to limit antibiotic use."
0,10,4,"few decades back, people died of various reasons but not of cancer or heart disease. later antibiotics were found to cure the infections. by then the virus or bacterial agents reacted to the antibiotics and the diseases were cured. but now the foreign particles developed resistance to the antibiotics and day by day the medicines are becoming helpless and new diseases are being diagnosed.so, if we take concern for these changes like buying chicken or fruit raised with antibiotic use we could slow down the arrival of the post-antibiotic world.so, we have to take the responsibility for the climate change and other perspectives affecting the environment"
0,14,7,"Through history, most people didn't die of cancer or hear disease, the lifestyle diseases that are common in the Western world today. This is mostly because people didn't live long enough to develop them. They died of injuries -- being gored by an ox, shot on a battlefield, crushed in one of the new factories of the Industrial revolution -- and most of the time from infection, which followed those injuries.

That changed when antibiotics were discovered. In 1928 Alexander Fleming discovered penicillin, a drug still used today to fight bacterial infections.

...
For 70 years, we played a game of leapfrog-- out drug and their resistance, and then another drugs, and then resistance again -- and now the game is ending, Bacteria develop resistance so quickly that pharameutical companies have decided making antibiotics is not in their best interest


If we did those things, we could slow down the arrival of the post-antibotic world."
0,13,2,"Up until recent history most human deaths weren't from causes that are common today. They mainly died from physical injury, mostly from infection caused by them. Upon the discovery of antibiotics in the 1920s this all changed. For a while this worked incredibly well. Now things are looking down. The bugs that cause these infections are becoming more and more resistant to antibiotics. We've been playing a game of ""leapfrog"" ever since the discovery of antibiotics. We'd find an antibiotic that would work, the bacteria would evolve so that it was resistant to it, then we'd discover a way to fight the resistant bacteria, rinse and repeat. Projected statistics say that by the year 2050 people will die at a rate of 10 million per year due to our inability to fight bacterial infections. That is more people than the current population of New York. There are ways we could slow this down, but it seems inevitable."
0,15,8,People didn't use to die of cancer and heart disease like today because they never lived long enough to get it. People used to die on accidents at work or infections that developed after injuries. This all change when penicillin was introduced to people. Penicillin was used as an antibiotic that cured infections that used to be a death sentence in a matter of days. It was estimated that penicillin saved around 12-15 percent of allied soldiers in the war. Our golden age of antibiotics is coming to a close because of superbugs. Superbugs were formed because of antibiotics making them resistant to them over time. We are now cutting back on antibiotics because the more we use them the stronger the superbugs become and the less likelihood of being able to treat infections and diseases. We should all resist the temptation of using antibiotics for certain infections to delay the end of antibiotics.
0,18,5,"Through history, most people don't die of cancer or heart disease is mostly because people don't live long enough to develop them. most death are from injuries such as being shot, crushed, and infections. Then in 1928, when antibiotics were made by Alexander fleeing to fight bacterial infections. The drug has saved around 15% of allied forces lives during world war II, but today people are dying from infections again due to antibiotic resistance. For 70 years, we played a game of leapfrog, our drug and their resistance, repeat over and over. That too comes a end, as bacteria now develop resistance quickly and people can't make new antibiotics fast enough to fight against them effectively. We could only do things to slow down the process of the bacteria. "
1,22,5,"In the past, people didn't used to die from cancer or heart attacks. This is not because they didn't exist, but because most people didn't live long enough to die from those causes. People died more often from injury, crushing, or infection. Until 1928, when Alexander created the antiobiotic to fight infections. 15% of troops were saved by antiobiotics during WWII. This too, however, comes to an end. It was a game of leapfrog, with bacteria progressing beyond antiobiotics and us catching up to the bacteria. Now we have antiobiotic-resistant bacteria. "
1,20,4,"People used to die of mysterious reasons. That reason was bacteria. Antibiotics are able to kill bacteria. Now bacteria are becoming resistant to antibiotics. If we buy food that has been treated with antibiotics, we can postpone a post antibiotic world. To do this, we need to think about the environment. "
1,26,1,People used to die from getting attacked or af reak accident but since they discovered penicillin the death rate is lower and eople live longer but now our bodies are getting used to the penicillin and if we dont stop overtaking medication by 2050 our death rate will start rising due to not being able to fight off infections anymore.
2,44,6,Before the 1900s people died of infections rather then cancer and heart disease as they do today. A man by the name of Alexander Phlegm-ing invented Penicillin that works by killing bacteria. Over time the bacteria began to mutate and more powerful antibiotics had to be developed. Over time the bacteria have also become resistant to the more powerful antibiotics that have been developed. Antibiotics are also found in livestock. The antibiotics found in livestock is also contributing to problems in humans. 
1,30,8,"People didn't die of cancer because they never lived long enough to get it. Before the invention of penicillin, people would succumb to those life-threatening diseases in matter of days. It is estimated that penicillin saved 12-15% of the allies on the war. However, our continued use of penicillin has made something known as super bugs which have become resistant to the effects of antibiotics. Try to avoid the use of antibiotics."
1,32,2,"The ways that people die nowadays are not the same as most people died for most of human history.  In the past, most people died from physical injuries they sustained and the subsequent infections that resulted from those injuries.  However, this changed in the 1920s with the discovery of antibiotics.  Antibiotics allowed us to treat infections and kill the associated bacteria.  However, our ability to do this is under threat.  Since the discovery of antibiotics, we've been playing a proverbial game of leap-frog with bacteria.  We'd develop an antibiotic to kill bacteria, then that bacteria would evolve to become resistant to the antibiotic, and then we'd develop a new antibiotic to kill the evolved bacteria.  But this will only go on for so long.  It's projected that by 2050, 10 million people per year will die from bacterial infections that are resistant to antibiotics.  That's more than the current population of New York.  There are ways that we could slow this phenomenon down, but even so, it seems inevitable."
1,34,3,"In the past people didnt  from old age and diseases because they simply didnt live long enough, with the discovered of antibiotics people were able to live longer. In modern times we face the reverse problem because now we have anitobiotic resistance."
1,33,7,"In today's world, people die of diseases like cancer and heart disease because we live longer. Years past, people died of infections usually from injuries or war. In 1928, Fleming discovered antibiotics. Over the years, bacteria are becoming more and more resistant to new antibiotics. Pharma companies are slowing down production because it is not in their best interest."
1,35,9,"antibiotics are becoming to ineffective, We have exposed to too many that bacteria are becoming superbugs. We need to cut down on meats and vegetable that use antibiotics."
1,36,6,"Before the 1900s people didn't die of cancer and heart disease. They died from infections. Alexander Phlegm-ing invented penicillin to destroy most bacterial infections. The bad part is bacteria mutate and become drug resistant. We make stronger antibiotics, they get immune to those too. The antibiotics in our livestock food ain't helping us, either."
2,37,4,People used to die of mysterious illnesses. Now we know the reason is bacteria. We now have antibiotics that kill bacteria. Bacteria are now becoming resistant to antibiotics. Food can be treated with antibacterial to postpone a post antibiotic world. We must take care of the environment first.
2,40,7,"These days, people day from diseases like hearts disease because of how long they live. In times past, people died younger because of infections. Now we have antibiotics to treat infections. In 1928, Fleming discovered antibiotics, however, now bacteria are becoming more resistant to antibiotics and pharmaceutical companies are not producing as many."
2,39,5,"People didn't used to die from things like heart attacks or cancer, because they often didn't live long to die from those. Instead they'd often die from simple infections. in 1928 Alexander created the first antibiotic to fight infections. Doing so saved 15% of troops during WWII. However, its a game of leapfrog. Antibiotics become resistant, which must be dealt with using new and improved antibiotics, which are then adapted to, and so on. This has led to antibiotic resistant bacteria."
2,38,3,"In the past people didn't die from old age, but from disease.  With the invention of antibiotics people began to live longer.
This started people being resistant to antibiotics and dying from disease."
2,41,2,In the past people died to physical wounds that were infected. This changed in the 1920's with the discovery of antibiotics. Since then we've been playing a game of leap-frog with bacteria. The bacteria would evolve and a new antibiotic would be developed. This can not continue forever though. It is estimated that by 2050 10 million people will die by bacterial infections. That is more than the population of New York City.
2,45,0,Most people died before they could be old enough for heart disease. Penicilin has made people live longer. People are becoming more resistant to penicilin. There are now super bugs that don't respond to antibiotics. These super bugs could wipe out an entire city the size of new york.
2,48,9,We need to cut down on meats and other things that use antibiotics because its creating resistant super bugs
2,49,1,"People used to die from different things such as freak accidents. But since the time that penicillin was discovered, people began to live a lot longer. However, as time has passed, our bodies have become more used to this and the effect that penicillin once had has begun to diminish. We must now find something different to use for if we don't stop taking this item by 2050 the number of deaths will increase."
3,50,8,"In the past, medicine was great for curing illnesses. Now, with drugs like penicillin, they have created superbugs, which are immune to current medicine."
3,52,6,"Before the 1900s, people died more often from infection than from cancer and heart disease. A man called Alexander Phlegming invented penicillin, which worked by killing bacteria. But over time the bacteria learned to mutate and more powerful antibiotics were needed. The bacteria actually became resistant to the antibiotics over time. Antibiotics that are found in livestock are adding to the issue for humans."
3,57,1,"The discovery of penicillin lead to many less deaths. However, humans need to find a new medicine to use because if we don't stop taking it by 2050, the number of deaths will begin increasing."
4,63,2,"Due to the overuse of antibiotics in the world, its effectiveness started to slow down. The use of antibiotics are really important and with this happening it could be seen that people will start getting hurt or possibly die from bacterial infections. "
4,75,6,"Before the 1900s, more people died from infections than heart disease and cancer. Alexander Phlegming invented penicillin that kills bacteria. Unfortunately bacteria have since mutated and become resistant and require ever more powerful antibiotics. The prevalence of antibiotic use in livestock has made bacteria even more resistant making the issue of antibiotic-resistant bacteria more difficult for humans."
3,51,7,"People are dying from heart disease now, than they were in the past.  People used to live shorter lives several decades ago, but are now able to live longer lives because the can take antibiotics.  However, there are some antibiotics that don't work because bacteria is becoming immune to the antibiotics.  Also, pharmacies are not making new antibiotics."
3,53,5,It was about the cancer research of a man and how he was able to achieve this endeavor.
3,54,0,A lot of people die before they are old enough to get heart disease. Penicillin has made people live longer but people are becoming more resistant to it. There are some bugs that don't respond to antibiotics that have the potential to wipe out an entire city.
3,55,3,people used to die fats and now they live longer thanks to modern day medicine.
3,56,4,"People died from illnesses in the past. Today, we know that bacteria caused many of these illnesses. We know can use antibiotics to kill these bacteria. However, many bacteria are becoming resistant to antibiotics. So we can include antibiotics in the food we eat to postpone bacteria becoming resistant to antibiotics."
3,58,2,"It is said that back in the days, people die from wound due to infection, but that has changed since the introduction of antibiotic. However, with the changing of bacteria, antibiotic is beginning to see a decline in its effectiveness. Experts are estimating that by the year 2050, millions will die due to bacterial infection."
3,62,9,"Given the overuse of antibiotics, viruses are gaining a resistance, so we need to cut down on antibiotic use."
4,65,0,"Most people die before they get heart disease. Penicillin has made people live longer, but more and more people are becoming resistant to it. There are some infections that penicillin cannot cure that can wipe out entire cities."
4,67,7,People are dying from heart disease. People are able to live longer due to antibiotics. Bacteria are becoming immune to antibiotics and pharmacies aren't making new ones.
4,73,8,"Current medicine, such as penicillin, is more effective but it is creating superbugs that are resistant to treatment."
4,77,5,This is a story about a man who was doing research on cancer and how he achieved his goals in what he was doing.
4,81,1,"Penicillin was very helpful to human health, but if we don't find something else to use soon, the number of deaths will begin to increase."
