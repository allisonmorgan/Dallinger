Over the years viruses have mutated and have become immune to many antibiotics they are called ""superbugs"". So we create stronger antibiotics and then the superbugs become even stronger.

But over time, bacteria have become resistant to penicillin and the derivatives that pharmaceutical companies research and develop. And the bacteria are evolving faster than the researchers can keep up with. So now, people are once again dying from infections for which we have no cure. And the pace is increasing.

They would die by being crushed in industrial accidents in one of the few factories around at that time, or mauled to death by an ox or from injury or infection. Since the development of antibiotics in 1928, people have lived a lot longer becuase we could treat those infections with this new regimen. 12-15% of allied soldiers were estimated to be saved from infection using antibiotics. We are now seeing a reversal of that after 70 years. Our bodies are becoming resistant to the antibiotics and a lot of the drugs will no longer work. An estimated 50 thousand people die from infections worldwide currently and if we don't figure out how to reverse this trend, by 2050 10 Million people, the population of New York City are estimated to die every year. We can take small steps now to prevent this by not using antibiotics for every little ear infection and things like that to prevent the build up of resistance to these life saving drugs.	network	0.7248925566673279	0.2662472724914551	0.0

But after penicillin was discovered in the early 20th century by Mr. Fleming, infections became possible to treat. Infections that once killed people, could now be cured within days, and easily. This resulted in a dramatic number of lives saved during World War I; somewhere between 10-15% of Allied forces by some estimates. Death from infections dropped dramatically everywhere.
But this is now changing. Bacteria evolve and develop resistances to antibiotic drugs, and for decades companies were constantly developing new drugs to kill bacteria as they became resistant to old ones. And now there are ""superbugs"" - types of bacteria that are immune to most, if not all, available antibiotics. And pharmaceutical companies are finding it too hard to develop new drugs. Already some 700,000 peopel a year are dying by infections worldwide, and if a solution isn't found by 2050 that number could rise to 10,000,000 a year - about the population of NYC.
There may come a day when only one or two, or no drugs at work on a given infection. And one way to combat this is by reducing our antibiotic use.

61	4	Advancements in medicine has lead to human having a longer life expectancy, but those advancements are also starting to cause problems. Antibiotics are used to treat bacterial infections and can be used too often, which causes the bacteria to change and become resistant to the antibiotics. If the bacteria continue to become stronger against the medicine, it will be difficult to treat bacterial infections and will cause life spans to become shorter again. That is why it is important to only treat with antibiotics if it is absolutely necessary.	network	0.01889427937567234	0.01524303574115038	0.9658626914024353

By 2050, it's expected that 10 million strains of bacteria will be antibiotic resistant. We can help prevent this by learning not to use antibiotics to treat things they aren't effective against, such as viral infections, and to only use them against bacteria when it's actually necessary, as with a serious infection, and not in cases where the body can handle the infection without assistance.	network	0.02750072069466114	0.03173325955867767	0.9407660365104675
