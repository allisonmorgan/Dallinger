For 70 years, we played a game of leapfrog -- our drug and their resistance, and then another drug, and then resistance again -- and now the game is ending. Bacteria develop resistance so quickly that pharmaceutical companies have decided making antibiotics is not in their best interest, so there are infections moving across the world for which, out of the more than 100 antibiotics available on the market, two drugs might work with side effects, or one drug, or none.

It would be natural to hope that these infections are extraordinary cases, but in fact, in the United States and Europe, 50 thousand people a year die of infections which no drugs can help. A project chartered by the British government known as the Review on Antimicrobial Resistance estimates that the worldwide toll right now is 700 thousand deaths a year. Also, if we can't get this under control by 2050, the worldwide toll will be 10 million deaths a year (more than the current population of New York City).

The scale of antibiotic resistance seems overwhelming, but if you've ever bought a fluorescent light bulb because you were concerned about climate change, you already know what it feels like to take a tiny step to address an overwhelming problem. We could take those kinds of steps for antibiotic use too. We could forgo giving an antibiotic for our kids’ ear infection, if we're not sure it's the right one.

The discovery of antibiotics saved many lives during World War II.\nUnfortunately, the issue of people dying from infections is once again on the rise. There is a new problem called \""superbugs\"". These are infections that are resistant to most or all strains of antibiotics that science has developed. It is likened to a road race between scientists developing new antibiotics and superbugs becoming resistant. The superbugs are quicker and they are winning.  Many pharmaceutical companies now don't feel it is advantageous for them to develop new antibiotics, so infections are now able to move across the world unchecked. It is estimated that in the future, more people than the entire population of NYC will be killed by these bugs.\nThere is something people can do to slow this phenomena. Not jumping into giving your child an antibiotic when they may have an ear infections, but you are not positive. Not jumping into taking antibiotics in general unless you are absolutely sure that the infection is present and the antibiotics are going to be effective in treating it is helpful.

Bacteria compete against each other for resources, for food, by manufacturing lethal compounds that they direct against each other. When we first made antibiotics, we took those compounds into the lab and made our own versions of them, and bacteria responded to our attack the way they always had.

For 70 years, we played a game of leapfrog -- our drug and their resistance, and then another drug, and then resistance again -- and now the game is ending. Bacteria develop resistance so quickly that pharmaceutical companies have decided making antibiotics is not in their best interest, so there are infections moving across the world for which, out of the more than 100 antibiotics available on the market, two drugs might work with side effects, or one drug, or none.

It would be natural to hope that these infections are extraordinary cases, but in fact, in the United States and Europe, 50 thousand people a year die of infections which no drugs can help. A project chartered by the British government known as the Review on Antimicrobial Resistance estimates that the worldwide toll right now is 700 thousand deaths a year. Also, if we can't get this under control by 2050, the worldwide toll will be 10 million deaths a year (more than the current population of New York City).

The scale of antibiotic resistance seems overwhelming, but if you've ever bought a fluorescent light bulb because you were concerned about climate change, you already know what it feels like to take a tiny step to address an overwhelming problem. We could take those kinds of steps for antibiotic use too. We could forgo giving an antibiotic for our kids’ ear infection, if we're not sure it's the right one. And we could promise each other to never again to buy chicken or shrimp or fruit raised with routine antibiotic use. If we did those things, we could slow down the arrival of the post-antibiotic world.

It is the phenomenon of infection causing bacteria and other pathogens getting more and more resistant to the antibiotics we develop as time goes by. We have a culture of overusing antibiotics. It started around the time of world war 2. Those times, people were constantly dying of infections as we had no solutions to these problems. Then Alexander Fleming discovered Penicillin in 1928. It saved almost 10-15% of the allied troops in said period. However, as time went by, we started overusing these antibiotics in everyday life, thereby the bugs got more resistant. Every year 50,000 people die in US and Europe alone because of this. We can combat this by taking antibiotics only if we are absolutely sure that we have infections, and by reducing consumption of antibiotics treated chicken and shrimp."",""generation"":1,""participant_id"":15}"
